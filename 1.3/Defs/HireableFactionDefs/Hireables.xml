        <description>An ultratech refugee society from the planet Sophiamunda.

They fled to the rimworld using the remnants of their fleet. Despite losing so much, their ships and technology still make them powerful.\n\nThey will refuse to trade with anyone who lacks the appropriate royal title.</description>
